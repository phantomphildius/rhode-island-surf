## Rhode Island Surf
[This project](https://rhode-island-surf.herokuapp.com/) is an experiment in ReactJS for me to learn more than EmberJS. It uses the C3 chart library to map forceast data from the [Magic Seaaweed API](https://magicseaweed.com). Styled with material-ui.

Locations currently include:
* Second Beach (Sachuset)
* First Beach (Easton)
* Ruggles
* Bailey's Beach
